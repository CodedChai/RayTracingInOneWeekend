# RayTracingInOneWeekend

I started by following Peter Shirley's minibooks to learn ray tracing. I initially started the project in Java but have now moved to writing it all in C++ to ensure I get the most out of it. 

I currently have it set up as a CPU ray tracer that is multi-threaded by OpenMP and outputs to a .PPM file. 
### Currently Supports
* Lambertian, metal and dielectric materials
* Depth of Field
* Anti-Aliasing 
* Motion Blur

## Things I have done that are outside the scope of the books:
* CPU Multi-Threading

## Things I want to do that are outside the scope of the books:
* GPU Rendering/Multi-Threading (Most likely with CUDA)
* OBJ model loading and rendering
* PNG format output
* Real-Time rendering
